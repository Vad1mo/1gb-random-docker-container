# 1GB Docker Image


This is a sample Docker image that generates a random 1GB file. 
Actually it is not exactly 1GB but 1.004GB because it is based on alpine linux that brings 4 MB.

# Why
Main reason behind this image is test the upload and download speed from and to a docker registry.


# Thanks
